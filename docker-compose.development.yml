      args:
        # FIXME: These should be the args used, but until Docker 1.13 is released with the enhancement at <https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/27702>, the build container cannot talk to the local-services IPs, as it won’t be on the same network.  Once that enhancement gets released, there should be a way to specify the network used for the build container here in Compose, perhaps with a `network` key within the `build` section.  For now, wire the Docker host IP address, as the port is published there anyway.
